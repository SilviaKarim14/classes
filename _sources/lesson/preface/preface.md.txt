## Conventions
$ 
> When showing examples of commands, the $ symbol precedes the actual command. So, the other lines are the output obtained after executing the command. An example invoking the ls command follows:

    $ ls


Commands on the NodeMCU are typically indicated with `>>>` the python
interpreter prompt. Example:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.listdir()

PORTALNAME
> In some examples we refer to your portal name as the PORTALNAME you have on FutureSystems.

USERNAME

> In some examples we refer to your local computers name as USERNAME. Your portal name and your local name may be different.

Menu selections
