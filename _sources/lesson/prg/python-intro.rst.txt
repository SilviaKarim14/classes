Introduction to Python
======================


Portions of this lesson have been adapted from the `official Python
Tutorial`_ copyright `Python Software Foundation`_.

Python is an easy to learn programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s simple syntax and dynamic
typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas
on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard
library are freely available in source or binary form for all major
platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may
be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of
and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and
tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter can be
extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or
other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an
extension language for customizable applications.

Python is an interpreted, dynamic, high-level programming language
suitable for a wide range of applications.


The philosophy of python is summarized in `The Zen of Python`_
as follows:

* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

The main features of Python are:

* Use of indentation whitespace to indicate blocks
* Object orient paradigm
* Dynamic typing
* Interpreted runtime
* Garbage collected memory management
* a large standard library
* a large repository of third-party libraries

Python is used by many companies (such as Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA)
and is applied for web development, scientific computing, embedded
applications, artificial intelligence, software development, and
information security, to name a few.

About the Tutorial
------------------

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a
Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. At the
end of this lesson you will be able to:

- use Python
- use the interactive Python interface
- understand the basic syntax of Python
- write and run Python programs stored in a file
- have an overview of the standard library
- install Python libraries using `pyenv` or if it is not available `virtualenv`

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every
single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it
introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give
you a good idea of the language's flavor and style. After reading it,
you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and
you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library
modules.

In order to conduct this lesson you need

* A computer with Python 2.7.13 or 3.6.2
* Familiarity with command line usage
* A text editor such as `PyCharm
  <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_, emacs, vi or others. You
  should identity which works best for you and set it up.

Python module of the week is a Web site that provides a number of
short examples on how to use some elementary python modules. Not all
modules are equally useful and you should decide if there are better
alternatives. However for beginners this site provides a number of
good examples
