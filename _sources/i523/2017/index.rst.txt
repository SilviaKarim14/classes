I523 Big Data Applications and Analytics (2017)
===============================================

.. warning:: This material will be modified and updated on a weekly
             bases througought the semester. Some unit and section
             numbers in the presentations may not correspond to our
             outline here as we have restructured the material.

.. note:: This class has a significant amount of programming
          assignments. One of the assignments is going to be a **term
          project** that requires programming. However it is possible
          to substitue the term project with an **academic term
          paper** that does not require programming. This however does
          not mean that you can skip the other programming
          assignments. Those electing doing the term paper can receive
          a maximum grade of an A- for the class. This class will not
          have any bonus projects as we want that you focus on the
          class assignments and make them truly outstanding.
